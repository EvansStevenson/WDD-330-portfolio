    <h1>Evans' Week05 Notes</h1>
    <a href="../">Go Back</a>
    <h1>Things I did</h1>
    <ul>
        <li> - Finished reading Ch10: Testing and Debugging</li>
        <li> - Created Structure for TODO app</li>
        <li> - Added "create task" funtionallity</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Notes from the reading:</h3>
    <p>I understand the importance of removing debugging elements such as alerts and debugger, but what about something like console.logs? should those be removed as well before publishing? </p>
    <p>"Any tests are better than no tests at all" is a rather low bar to set. I guess it is true, however. Any project that does not have a plan or a way to test its validity is doomed to fail. What would a good testing method be for a project as simple as our todo app? </p>
    <h3>code samples</h3>
    <p>Please follow the link below to see my progress on the todo app. Thank you!</p>
