    <h1>Things I did</h1>
    <ul>
        <li> - Finished reading Ch11: Further Functions.</li>
        <li> - Finished reading Ch13: Ch13: AJAX.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Notes from the reading:</h3>
    <p>What are some practical examples for using the call method on a function object?</p>
    <p>I never would have thought to redefine a function within that same function! What are some examples of why I would
        want to do this?</p>
    <p>It is crazy how much you can do with functions because they are objects. Using functions as variables, returning
        functions and recursive functions are all very interesting and I cannot wait to implement them! </p>
    <p>I wish we learned about fetch in cs213. THe XMLHttpRequest objects were pretty difficult to understand and were hard to read. Fetch is much better!</p>
    <p>Are there any other ways to update a webpage with data from a server without reloading?</p>
