    <h1>Evans' Week09 Notes</h1>
    <a href="../">Go Back</a>

    <h1>Things I did</h1>
    <ul>
        <li> - Finished reading Ch9: The Window Object.</li>
        <li> - Finished reading Ch14: HTML5 APIs.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Notes from the reading:</h3>
    <p>window.history.go is very interesting to me. I will want to test these out!</p>
    <p>What problems would I want to use window.history.go to solve?</p>
    <p>If you needed something on your page to be up to date with a data store would using setInterval be the best way
        to constantly check for changes in a datastore?</p>
    <p>4KB for a cookie seems rather small. I wonder when you would need anywhere close to 5GB for web storage though.</p>
    <p>Note to self! Try using getCurrentPosition()</p>
    <p>is HTML5 a reason that lead to the death of flash? What happend to flash?</p>
    <h3>Other stuff</h3>
    <p>Finished all of the stretch challenges for this weeks team activity (see link below)</p>
