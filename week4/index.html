    <h1>Things I did</h1>
    <ul>
        <li> - Finished reading Ch8: Forms</li>
        <li> - Finished reading Ch12: OOP</li>
        <li> - Finished reading Ch15: Modern Javascript</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Notes from the reading:</h3>
    <p>When should I use a "reset" button in my forms?</p>
    <p>
        Note: Do not have sensitive information in a hidden field, or rather, do not rely on hidden fields for sensitive
        data
    </p>
    <p>Why is "monkey-patching" frowned upon in js more than in other languages?</p>
    <p>exports seem very handy and would work very well with the MCV design pattern</p>
    <h3>code samples</h3>
    <p>
        With my team, I completed making the tick-tack-toe board and adding an event listener that would reference a
        function that would edit the div selected by the player. For my project for this week, on top of the reading, I
        added game logic and tests to attempt to eliminate any false/illegal inputs such as overwriting an already
        selected div or continuing to play if someone has won. I tried to make it as automated as I could.
