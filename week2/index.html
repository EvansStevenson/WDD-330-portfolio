    <h3>Notes from the reading:</h3>
    <p>I do not understand why Java Script does not require semicolons if its such a bad idea to not use them</p>
    <p>Why can I define a string with either single quotes or double quotes?</p>
    <p>Why would I want two variables pointing to the same symbol?</p>
    <p>When do I want to use base 8 notation?</p>
    <p>NaN stands for Not a Number</p>
    <p>I did not know that Java Script will stop checking operands if it already evaluates something as true or false. Does increase performance or something?</p>
    <p>I have been told that you should always hard equality. Are there situations where you should use soft equality?</p>
    <p>In what situations should you use a set over an array?</p>
