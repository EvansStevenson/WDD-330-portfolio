    <h1>Evans' Week01 Notes</h1>
    <a href="../">Go Back</a>
    <h4>Code Management: What I did</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>I finished reading the syllabus</li>
        <li>I finished reading about Local Storage</li>
        <li>Already had an account on Github</li>
        <li>Created a new repository for this class</li>
        <li>Linked repository to my local machine thorugh the command line</li>
        <li>Created index.html in root of repository</li>
        <li>I turned on Github pages: <a
                href="https://masterlink0.github.io/WDD-330-portfolio/">https://masterlink0.github.io/WDD-330-portfolio/</a>
        </li>
        <li>Created Dynamic Table of Contents</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Note:</h5>
    <p>I created an array of js objects in a way that reduced the amount of lines that would be needed
        to include 14 weeks of very simmilar onjects down to a simple function. Please reference my git hub repository
        to see the main.js code <a href="https://github.com/masterlink0/WDD-330-portfolio.git">
            https://github.com/masterlink0/WDD-330-portfolio.git</a>
    </p>
    <h5>Master Mobile UX thoughts/questions</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>I cant believe that Industry-standard for what we view online content on did not change for 30 years!</li>
        <li>That was a very good clarification! When I took cs213 we learned about making pages responsive. At the
            time I thought that was good enough. It is good to know designing something to be "mobile first" is not
            the same as having a responsive retrofitted website. </li>
    </ul>
